# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
# Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to generate predictions for where to make investments for companies supported by Alphabet Soup. The given data includes over 34,000 organizations and the goal of this repository is to predict which companies will be successful if funded so that the limited amount of funding can go to them. 

# Results
## Data Preprocessing
### What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
The target variable is the "Is Successful" variable since that is the target output. In the end, whether the organization is successful is the objective.
### What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
All other variables asides from the EIN and Name variables are the features or input variables since they all impact the success of the organization. Name has no relation to success.
### What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
The EID and Name variables should be removed from the input data since they do not affect success nor indicate success.

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
